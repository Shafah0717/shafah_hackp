# Indoor Outdoor Prediction

<ul>
<li>Open google colab</li>
<li>git clone my files .ipynb and .pth(model trained by me)</li>
<li>Login into Kaggle Go to setting set api token it will give kaggle.json </li>
<li>[1] cell it will ask to upload kaggle.json </li>
<li>[2] Run second cell to hidden the kaggle.json</li>
<li>[3] Downloading and unzip the dataset from kaggle</li>
<li>[4] The file structure more nested it is tough to train the model</li>
<li>[4] so we run this cell to spilt the dataset to training data and testing data</li>
<li>[5] SO we run main code Here if the pth file not insert it will train the model if it is already uploaded to base directory</li>
<l1>[5] it will ask the image to test just upload</l1>
<li>It will predict the image and give the output</li>
</ul>
